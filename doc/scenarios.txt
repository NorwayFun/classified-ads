Small stories that have some consequences and hopefully not many
unintended consequences:
 
1. node with empty datastore connects a node
 -> good outcome is that it can receive list of other nodes currently
    on line and connect at least some of those so that its 
    own presense in the network with valid network address gets
    shared. 

2. node with stored list of peers is opened
 -> about some intention as in previous case "with empty datastore",
    now we have some nodes to start with.
