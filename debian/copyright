openssl ("Library for openssl toolkit")
 While Classified Ads does not include openssl, it heavily relies
 on its functionality and at runtime links to openssl libraries that
 must have been installed into system. 

 This product includes software developed by the OpenSSL Project    
 for use in the OpenSSL Toolkit (http://www.openssl.org/)

 In addition, as a special exception, the copyright holders give  
 permission to link the code of portions of this program with the   
 OpenSSL library under certain conditions as described in each  
 individual source file, and distribute linked combinations  
 including the two.  

 You must obey the GNU General Public License in all respects  
 for all of the code used other than OpenSSL.  If you modify  
 file(s) with this exception, you may extend this exception to your  
 version of the file(s), but you are not obligated to do so.  If you  
 do not wish to do so, delete this exception statement from your  
 version.  If you delete this exception statement from all source  
 files in the program, then also delete it here.
