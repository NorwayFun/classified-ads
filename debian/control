Description: Program for displaying classified advertisement items
 Classified ads is an attempt to re-produce parts of the functionality 
 that went away when usenet news ceased to exist. This attempt tries to 
 fix the problem of disappearing news-servers so that there is no 
 servers required ; data storage is implemented inside client 
 applications that you and me are running. Features of the program 
 currently include
  * Posting of ads online, with categorization
  * Replying to ads either in public or privately to operator.
  * Binary attachments to posts.
  * Providing basic data of operators - data that operator may enter 
    himself, or left blank.
  * Basic searching of content based on words.
