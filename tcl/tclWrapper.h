/**
 * @brief Class providing TCL interpreter services
 *
 * This class wraps [TCL](http://www.tcl.tk) interpreter in 
 * [safe mode](https://www.tcl.tk/man/tcl8.6/TclCmd/safe.htm). 
 * This class is intended to be used so that, this 
 * is instantiated once and deleted at application shutdown. 
 * One TCL program may be running at same time - restriction of 
 * Tk is that one instance per process only.
 *
 * This is a thread and it is supposed to be used so that
 * class is instantiated, setScript() method is called,
 * followed by start(). Start may be called multiple times,
 * calling start() when thread is already executing has
 * no effect. In user interface user may open the TCL
 * console dialog from menu, commands typed are evaluated
 * using an interpreter. In addition to "ad-hoc" commands
 * to interpreter, a program text may be stored into 
 * TCL program library. 
 *
 * Classified-ads implements a local data storage for TCL
 * programs but a precondition for its successful usage is 
 * that program being run has been previously stored into
 * TCL program library of classified ads. Reason for this 
 * the underlying database implementation: each program may
 * have its own local data but for being able to associate 
 * the program with the data, the program must be stored
 * first. Longer TCL program may be typed directly into
 * "TCL Programs" dialog but for really long programs it
 * is naturally easier to use a proper code-editor and then
 * just copy-paste the code in classified-ads as it does not
 * implement a proper code-editor, just a "normal" text editor.
 * TCL interpreter output for debugging purposes may be seen
 * at "TCL Interpreter" dialog in the UI. Stdout+stderr of
 * the interpreter are directed there. At time of writing there
 * is known issue with very long output lines and output lines
 * containing non-ASCII7 -characters like accented characters
 * of finnish language. Using those will not stop the interpreter
 * or program but will break interpreter output. 
 *
 * In addition to standard safe-mode-TCL/TK this wrapper
 * introduces several TCL extension commands for accessing
 * features implemented uniquely by classified-ads software. 
 * These features include for example search, fetch and post
 * of an classified ad. List of additional commands is
 *
 *   TCL command                              | Purpose
 *   ---------------------------------------  | -------------
 *   [listProfiles](@ref listProfilesLabel)   | Returns list of profile id's matching given conditions
 *   [listComments](@ref listCommentsLabel)   | Returns list of profile comment id's matching given conditions
 *   [listAds](@ref listAdsLabel)             | Returns list of classified ad id's matching given conditions
 *   [getProfile](@ref getProfileLabel)       | Returns profile details by id
 *   [getProfileComment](@ref getCommentLabel)| Returns profile comment by id
 *   [getClassifiedAd](@ref getAdLabel)       | Returns classified ad by id
 *   [getBinaryFile](@ref getFileLabel)       | Returns binary file by id
 *
 * Longer documentation of each command follows. 
 * 
 * listProfiles {#listProfilesLabel}
 * ============
 * Basic usage of listProfiles is 
 * ```
 * set profileList [ listProfiles foobar ]
 * ```
 * after which profileList contans a (possibly empty) array of
 * profile idenfiers. The search condition here is the word
 * "foobar" that is used to match profiles from search index. 
 * Returned list is list of dictionaries. Each dictionary
 * has as its key profile address (SHA1) and in its value the
 * "display name" of the profile, that is human-readable combination
 * of profile address, nickname, given and family names. 
 *
 * The search engine in use is the powerful full-text-search (FTS) 
 * feature of the sqlite database. It is well documented in 
 * [SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/fts3.html). 
 * For a profile to be indexed for search purposes, it must be
 * a public profile. The fields that are put into index are
 *  * profile address (SHA1 identifier), field name = profilehash
 *  * nickname, field name = nickname
 *  * greeting text, field name = greetingtext
 *  * first name, field name = firstname
 *  * family name, field name = familyname
 *  * city, field name = city
 *  * btc wallet address, field name = btc
 *  * state, field name = state
 *
 * Example queries include
 * ```
 * set profileList [ listProfiles {a*} ]
 * ```
 * that set value of `profileList` to contain every profile from local
 * storage that in some indexed field contains a word that begins 
 * with letter "a". 
 * ```
 * set profileList [ listProfiles {Suomi Finland} ]
 * ```
 * that returns every profile that in some indexed field
 * contain word "Suomi" and also word "Finland". If only 
 * "Suomi" or "Finland" is present, profile is not returned
 * ```
 * set profileList [ listProfiles {Suomi OR Finland} ]
 * ```
 * that returns every profile that in some indexed field
 * contain word "Suomi" or word "Finland".
 * ```
 * set profileList [ listProfiles {nickname:s*} ]
 * ```
 * Returns profiles that in nickname field have a word that
 * begins with letter "s". Example content of $profileList from such a 
 * query might be for example
 * 
 * ```
 * {1D2CB451BD348B12BA39316499F5AF6D53ACEECF Simo} 
 * {22C13DCF54C8D9E6148C834E601683DD894FCBF5 {Elmeri Sukeltaja}} 
 * {52F79319C034BA9939E930A5BD812B6CBE5DF2DD {Susanna K}}
 * ```
 *
 * Search is performed on local data only
 * 
 * listComments {#listCommentsLabel}
 * ============
 * listComments is similar in function as command
 * [listProfiles](@ref listProfilesLabel) but it returns profile 
 * comments instead.
 * ```
 * set commentList [ listComments foobar ]
 * ```
 * Would return every profile comment with word foobar in text. 
 * Indexed fields are
 *  * Commented profile identifier (SHA1), field name = profilehash
 *  * Author profile identifier (SHA1), field name = commentorhash
 *  * Comment text , field name = comment
 *  * Comment subject line, field name = commentsubject
 *  * Nickname of autoher, field name = commentornickname
 *
 * Results are returned in same manner, as a list of dictionaries
 * where key is the comment SHA1 identifier and value is
 * comment subject. 
 *
 * listAds {#listAdsLabel}
 * ============
 * listAds is similar in function as command
 * [listProfiles](@ref listProfilesLabel) but it returns identifiers
 * of classified ads instead.
 * ```
 * set adList [ listAds computer ]
 * ```
 * Would return every classified ad with word foobar in any indexed field. 
 * Indexed fields are
 *  * Author profile identifier (SHA1), field name = senderhash
 *  * Author profile display name, field name = sendername
 *  * Subject, field name = subject
 *  * Text of the ad, field name = text
 *
 * Results are returned in same manner, as a list of dictionaries
 * where key is the SHA1 identifier of the classified ad and value is
 * ad subject. 
 *
 * getProfile {#getProfileLabel}
 * ============
 * getProfile returns details of operator profile. Argument is the 
 * SHA1 identifier of the profile. Profile is returned as a dictionary
 * where keys are mapped to their values. 
 * ```
 * set p [ getProfile $profileIdentifier ]
 * ```
 * The keys in the dictionary are the following
 * 
 *  
 *   Key                | Description of the value
 *   ------------------ | ----------------------------------
 *   displayName        | Human-readable name of profile
 *   fingerPrint        | Profile SHA1 address
 *   greetingText       | Operator greeting text
 *   firstName          | Operator given name

 *   cityCountry        | Operator city/country
 *   timeOfPublish      | Time of last publish, as seconds since 1-Jan-1970
 *   isPrivate          | Boolean indicating if profile is private
 *   imagePNG           | Image data of profile picture
 *   BTCAddress         | BTC wallet address of the operator
 *   stateOfTheWorld    | Situation with the world, as perceived by the operator
 *   profileReaders     | List of profiles readers, value is list of operator profiles
 *   sharedFiles        | List of files shared by profile, value is list of file SHA1 identifiers
 *   trustList          | List of profiles publicly trusted by this operator
 *
 * Every field may be omitted from dictionary if there is no value. 
 * Value is always present in fields fingerPrint, isPrivate, timeOfPublish 
 * and displayName. Note that operators own profile may not have been 
 * published at all and for this reason getting operators own profile 
 * may fail. Inside TCL programs the current profile SHA1 is stored in 
 * global variable `::profileInUse` so command `getProfile $::profileInUse` 
 * should always return details of operators own profile, if published. 
 *
 * getProfileComment {#getCommentLabel}
 * ============
 * getProfileComment returns single comment to some operators profile. 
 * Argument is the  SHA1 identifier of the comment as returned by
 * [listComments](@ref listCommentsLabel) command. Comment is returned 
 * as a dictionary where keys are mapped to their values. 
 * ```
 * set c [ getProfileComment $commentIdentifier ]
 * ```
 * The keys in the dictionary are the following
 *  
 *   Key                    | Description of the value

 *   replyTo                | SHA1 id of comment that this comments is a reply to
 *   attachedFiles          | List of files attached to this comment, value is list of file SHA1 identifiers
 *
 * getClassifiedAd {#getAdLabel}
 * ============
 * getClassifiedAd is similar in function to [getProfileComment](@ref getCommentLabel) 
 * command but it returns an classified ad.
